"""Platform checks behind GET /api/checks.

Each check is a small function returning (status, detail, help); CHECKS lists them in display order.
run() never raises: a check that throws becomes a fail row, every detail is scrubbed of credentials,
and the checks run in parallel daemon threads under a 12 s deadline.

CHECKS is the one registry the page, /api/checks and cloud_suite.py share (#19). Each entry has
applies(server, python), false where the check doesn't fit (the row is a skip with the reason), and a tier:
quick runs here on every request; full needs the Cloud CLI, so cloud_suite.py runs it and posts the result
back, and the row shows that.

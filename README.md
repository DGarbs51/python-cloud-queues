# python-cloud-queues

A plain Python app (no web framework) that tells you whether Python works on a
[Laravel Cloud](https://cloud.laravel.com) deployment. Deploy it, open it, press **Run all
checks**, and read the result: every row is pass, warning, fail or skipped, with a plain
explanation of anything that isn't a pass.

It checks the things a real Python app depends on:

| Group | What it checks |
|---|---|
| Web | server and process count vs `WEB_CONCURRENCY`, `WEB_CONCURRENCY` vs Cloud's sizing formula, `PORT`, the proxy headers (`X-Forwarded-Proto`, `X-Forwarded-For`, `Cloud-Request-ID`), the async event loop isn't blocked, a WebSocket upgrade through Cloud's proxy (ASGI servers only), that the pod's nginx reaches the app over IPv6, that streamed responses (`/api/stream`, server-sent events) arrive as sent with and without `X-Accel-Buffering: no`, that nginx serves `public/` itself with Cloud's cache headers while refusing dotfiles, logs and SQL dumps, and (from `cloud_suite.py --tier full`) the largest upload that gets through |
| Logging | [laravel-cloud-logging](https://pypi.org/project/laravel-cloud-logging/) is installed, Cloud's log socket is reachable, and (from `cloud_suite.py --tier full`) logs render correctly in Cloud's log viewer |
| Runtime | Python version vs `.python-version`, the newest patch release and end of life ([endoflife.date](https://endoflife.date/python)), the standard library's C extensions, time-zone data and UTF-8, installed packages vs `uv.lock`, outbound HTTPS, `/tmp`, CPU and memory limits, subprocesses, threads |
| Services | Valkey/Redis `PING`, database `SELECT 1` (MySQL or Postgres, from `DATABASE_URL`), DNS for both |
| Queue | seven jobs through [laravel-cloud-queues](https://pypi.org/project/laravel-cloud-queues/): plain, async, delayed, retried, failing, timed out and a burst of 20 |
| Throughput | N async jobs (default 1,000) through the queue: jobs per second, p95 wait, lost and duplicated jobs |

Checks that only make sense on Cloud (proxy headers, streaming, static files, log socket, cgroup
limits) are skipped when you run locally. `GET /api/packages` lists this Python, the native
libraries it's built against (OpenSSL, SQLite, zlib, expat) and every installed package by location.

## Deploy to Laravel Cloud

One application, one environment per branch. Each branch differs from `main` only in
`.python-version` (which Cloud reads to pick the runtime) or `.web-server` (which `serve.py`
reads to pick the web server). `main` is Python 3.14 on uvicorn.

| Branch | Python | Web server |
|---|---|---|
| `python-3.10` … `python-3.14` | 3.10 … 3.14 | uvicorn |
| `server-gunicorn`, `server-uwsgi`, `server-waitress` | `main`'s | WSGI |
| `server-granian-wsgi`, `server-hypercorn-wsgi` | `main`'s | WSGI |
| `server-granian-asgi`, `server-hypercorn-asgi`, `server-daphne` | `main`'s | ASGI |

These are the servers Cloud's [Python deploy guide](https://cloud.laravel.com/docs/deploy-guides/python#run-a-production-server)
supports. To test a server on another Python, change `.python-version` on its branch and push.

Pushing a branch deploys its environment. To ship `main` to every environment (or the ones named):

```sh
uv run python scripts/ship.py [env ...]
```

It merges `origin/main` into each branch in a scratch worktree and pushes. On a conflict `main` wins
except for the branch's own `.python-version` or `.web-server`; anything it can't resolve stops the run.
Then it waits until every environment's latest deployment is at its branch head and finished, and exits
non-zero if any deploy failed or is still running after 30 minutes. You need the
[Cloud CLI](https://cloud.laravel.com/docs/cli) (`cpx laravel/cloud-cli`), logged in.

Every environment uses the same settings, so results compare across versions:

- **Start command:** `python serve.py`. It execs the server named in `.web-server` with the
  command listed in `serve.py` (`[::]:$PORT`, workers from `WEB_CONCURRENCY`). The `python-3.x`
  environments may keep `uvicorn asgi:app --host :: --port $PORT`; it runs the same thing.
- **App and Worker cluster:** `pro.g-2vcpu-4gb`, autoscaling 1–6 replicas (CPU 60%, memory 70%), scale-to-zero off.
- **Worker cluster:** 4 processes of `laravel-cloud-queues work app:registry`. Don't add
  `--stop-when-empty`: Cloud restarts any worker that exits, which the timeout case relies on.
- **Valkey cache** attached (Cloud injects `REDIS_URL`) and `LARAVEL_CLOUD_QUEUES_BACKEND=redis`.
- **Database** (optional) attached; Cloud injects `DATABASE_URL`. Set `DB_SSL_VERIFY=0` for
  Cloud's self-signed database proxy.
- Deploy command empty. Build command: the `cloud-bootstrap` copy is temporary (see
  [cloud-bootstrap/](cloud-bootstrap/README.md)); `laravel-cloud-logging-config logging.json`
  writes the logging config uvicorn, granian and hypercorn read with `--log-config`, so their
  main-process lines are JSON too. `serve.py` won't start those servers without it.
  `if [ -d cloud-bootstrap ]; then mkdir -p "$(python -m site --user-site)" && cp cloud-bootstrap/laravel_cloud_bootstrap.py cloud-bootstrap/zz_laravel_cloud_bootstrap.pth "$(python -m site --user-site)/"; fi && laravel-cloud-logging-config logging.json`

The server must accept both IPv6 and IPv4 on `$PORT`: Cloud's startup probes connect over IPv6,
while the pod's nginx currently connects to `127.0.0.1`. `[::]` is dual-stack for most servers;
waitress makes it IPv6-only, so `serve.py` also gives it `0.0.0.0`. Use `--host ::`, not
`--host ''`: with several workers uvicorn binds an IPv4-only socket for `''`, which the probes
can't reach.

The page header shows which server answered. Under WSGI servers the async and WebSocket rows
are skipped. waitress (threads) and daphne have no process count, so they run one process
whatever `WEB_CONCURRENCY` says, and waitress exits on SIGTERM without draining requests.

The app has no login. Protect it at the network level.

## Run locally

You need [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), Valkey/Redis (Laravel Herd bundles one on
`127.0.0.1:6379`) and optionally MySQL.

```sh
cp .env.example .env
uv run --env-file .env uvicorn asgi:app --host :: --port 8000   # http://localhost:8000
uv run --env-file .env laravel-cloud-queues work app:registry   # second terminal; more for more workers
```

In a terminal, logs print as readable lines; piped output and Cloud get the JSON lines Cloud
parses (`LOG_FORMAT=json` or `line` forces either). To read, filter or follow a running process
like `php artisan pail`, run it through laravel-cloud-logging's viewer:

```sh
uv run --env-file .env python -m laravel_cloud_logging.pretty -- uvicorn asgi:app --host :: --port 8000
uv run --env-file .env python -m laravel_cloud_logging.pretty --level warning -- laravel-cloud-queues work app:registry
```

It keeps the command's exit code and forwards `SIGTERM`, so supervisors still see crashes.
`solo.yml` runs Web and Worker this way.

Locally nothing restarts a worker that exits, so the queue's timeout case only passes with a
restart loop: `while true; do uv run --env-file .env laravel-cloud-queues work app:registry; done`.

## Regression suite

After shipping, run every check on every environment, save the results and compare them with the last run (#19):

```sh
uv run python cloud_suite.py --tier quick [env ...]   # every row of GET /api/checks, all environments in parallel
uv run python cloud_suite.py --tier full [env ...]    # also the full-tier jobs (Cloud CLI): logs in Cloud's viewer
```

Each run writes `results/<UTC time>.json` (one row per environment and check: pass, warn, fail or skip,
with the detail) and diffs it against the previous file of the same tier. A regression is a check that
went from pass to fail, or a count that got worse (e.g. plain-text log lines). It prints one table with
regressions marked `!` and exits non-zero on any regression or failure. The three proxy rows that fail
everywhere until base-images ships its nginx fixes (#15) are shown as `known, #15` and don't fail the run.

`checks.CHECKS` is the one registry. Each entry has `applies(server, python)` (where it doesn't apply,
the row is a skip with the reason) and a tier: `quick` runs in the app on every **Run all checks**;
`full` needs the Cloud CLI, so its job lives in `cloud_suite.JOBS` and the suite posts its result back to
the row (`POST /api/suite-results`). Until then the row says to run `cloud_suite.py --tier full`. The
app never calls the Cloud API itself. `test_checks.py` fails if an entry is missing either field, or a
full-tier entry and its job don't match.

## Upload limit

**The largest request body Cloud accepts is 500 MiB (524,288,000 bytes).** Cloudflare's edge sets it,
in front of everything in the environment, so no environment setting raises it. One byte more gets
Cloudflare's own `413 Payload Too Large` page, straight away, from the `Content-Length`. Without a
`Content-Length` (a chunked or streamed upload), Cloudflare counts the bytes and returns the same `413`
once the body passes the limit. The pod's nginx allows 2048M, so it's never the one that refuses.

Your web server can set a lower limit. hypercorn's WSGI mode (`hypercorn wsgi:app`) holds the whole body
in memory and answers an empty `400` above **16 MiB**; raise `wsgi_max_body_size` in a `-c` config file
(there's no CLI flag). hypercorn's ASGI mode and the other servers here don't cap it below Cloudflare's 500 MiB.

An upload under the limit can still fail on the environment's HTTP timeout (5–60 s) on a slow link.
For bigger files, or slow uploaders, upload straight to object storage with a presigned URL.

`POST /api/upload` counts the body in 1 MiB chunks without keeping it and returns `{"bytes": n}` (its
own cap is 512 MiB). To measure it on every environment:

```sh
uv run python upload_check.py [env ...]   # 1 MB to 500 MiB + 1 byte, then 501 MiB with no Content-Length
```

## HTTP load

Throughput through the queue is on the page. For requests per second through Cloud's ingress,
run [k6](https://k6.io) from your machine:

```sh
k6 run -e BASE_URL=https://your-app.laravel.cloud k6/http.js
```

It ramps to 50 virtual users and fails if more than 1% of requests fail or p95 latency is over
500 ms.

## Tests

```sh
uv run python app.py --self-check              # router and logging
uv run --env-file .env python test_checks.py   # check contract
uv run --env-file .env python test_throughput.py
uv run python test_servers.py [server ...]     # boots every server in serve.py the way Cloud does
uv run python logs_check.py [env ...]          # on Cloud: levels, exceptions, request IDs, plain lines (#17)
uv run python upload_check.py [env ...]        # on Cloud: the largest upload through Cloud's proxy (#10)
uv run python cloud_suite.py --tier full       # on Cloud: everything above, diffed against the last run
```

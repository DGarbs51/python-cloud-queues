# python-cloud-queues

A plain-Python (no web framework) demo of [`laravel-cloud-queues`](https://pypi.org/project/laravel-cloud-queues/),
installed from PyPI. It proves the queue driver works on a Laravel Cloud deployment: a
dashboard shows jobs as they are queued and processed, and **Run check** dispatches a fixed
set of jobs and gives a pass/fail verdict for each, so the same check can be rerun after
changing Python version, cluster size, instance type or cache.

The FastAPI version with the same dashboard and check is
[`fastapi-cloud-queues`](https://github.com/DGarbs51/fastapi-cloud-queues).

## Branches: one per Python version

| Branch | Python |
|---|---|
| `python-3.10` | 3.10 |
| `python-3.11` | 3.11 |
| `python-3.12` | 3.12 |
| `python-3.13` | 3.13 |
| `python-3.14` | 3.14 |

The branches differ from `main` only in `.python-version`, which Laravel Cloud reads to
pick the runtime. Deploy each branch as its own application, with its own Valkey cache.
Make changes on `main` and merge them into every branch:

```sh
for v in 3.10 3.11 3.12 3.13 3.14; do
  git switch python-$v && git merge --no-edit main && git push
done
git switch main
```

## Deploy to Laravel Cloud

1. Create an application from this repository and pick a `python-3.x` branch.
2. Attach a Laravel Valkey cache. Cloud injects `REDIS_URL`.
3. Set `LARAVEL_CLOUD_QUEUES_BACKEND=redis`.
4. Leave the build command empty; Cloud installs dependencies with uv from `uv.lock`.
5. Set the start command to `python app.py`. It listens on `0.0.0.0:$PORT` whenever `PORT` is set. Cloud auto-detects FastAPI apps; this plain-Python one has not been deployed yet, so check that Cloud accepts the start command.
6. Add workers, as background processes on the App cluster and/or a worker cluster:

   ```sh
   python -m laravel_cloud_queues.cli work app:registry
   ```

   Set `WORKER_LABEL` (for example `app-cluster` or `worker-cluster`) on each so the
   dashboard shows where each job ran. Run at least two workers: the timeout case exits the
   worker that runs it.

Protect the app at the network level; the dashboard and dispatch endpoints have no login.

## Run check

The check dispatches one job per case and polls what the workers recorded:

| Case | Passes when |
|---|---|
| `quick` | a sync job is processed on attempt 1 |
| `async` | an async job is processed on attempt 1 |
| `delayed` | a job dispatched with a 5 s delay starts at least 5 s later |
| `flaky` | a job that fails once is released, then processed on attempt 2 |
| `failing` | a job that always fails is released, then failed on attempt 2 |
| `timeout` | a job over its 3 s timeout exits the worker (exit 124), the platform restarts it, and the job is redelivered after the 60 s Redis lease |
| `burst` | 20 jobs are each processed exactly once |
| `workers` | at least one worker ran, and every worker runs the same Python version as the web process |

A full run takes one to two minutes because of the timeout case. A case still waiting after
240 s fails.

## What the dashboard shows

- **Queue depth**: ready, delayed (including retry backoff) and reserved (in-flight) jobs,
  read from the package's Redis keys. Shown in `redis` mode only.
- **Totals and recent events**: `queued`, `started`, `processed`, `released` and `failed`.
  Outside managed mode the package emits no lifecycle events, so each job records its own
  telemetry into Valkey (`lcq-demo:*`) using `current_job()`. The store falls back to
  `REDIS_URL` in other modes, so the dashboard keeps working after a switch to managed queues.
- **Workers**: worker label, process and Python version for the last minute.

## Run locally

You need Redis or Valkey (Laravel Herd bundles Valkey on `127.0.0.1:6379`) and
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```sh
uv sync
export LARAVEL_CLOUD_QUEUES_BACKEND=redis
export LARAVEL_CLOUD_QUEUES_REDIS_URL=redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0

uv run python app.py                           # dashboard on http://127.0.0.1:8000
uv run laravel-cloud-queues work app:registry  # in a second terminal; run more to scale
```

Locally nothing restarts a worker that exits, so the `timeout` case only passes with a
restart loop: `while true; do uv run laravel-cloud-queues work app:registry; done`.

## Files

- `app.py`: the `Registry`, the jobs and the standard-library web server.
- `telemetry.py`: job telemetry, dashboard data and the check. Identical in both demo
  repositories; keep them in sync.
- `index.html`: the dashboard (Tailwind CSS from the CDN, no build step).
